# Languages Written in Rust

This is a (probably incomplete) list of languages implemented in
Rust. It is intended as a source of inspiration and comparison, and as a
directory of potentially interesting projects in this vein.

## What Can Be Included?

1. Is it a language?
2. Is it written in Rust?

Then it can be included in this list!

*: Parcel is a large project of which the JavaScript transformer (written in Rust)
is a small part. The "stars" number here reflects the whole project, which is
broader than a programming language project.
